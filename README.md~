# How to use the color functions

You have to install the Colorama library through Pip, or your operating system's package manager.

# Current functions

1. Basic math
  - Provides an easy way to add, subtract, divide, and multiply 2 numbers.

2. Highlighted text
  - Using the hiw() function, you can print highlighted text for stuff like menus.

3. Screen clearing
  - Using the cls() function you can clear the screen on both Windows and Unix-like operating systems.

4. Waiting a set amount of seconds
  - Use the wait() function to wait a certain amount of seconds, specified inbetween the parenthesis.

5. Printing the OS using getsys()

  - When you call the getsys() function, it will print the OS name, if you aren't on Windows it will print 'Unix-like'.

6. Printing the credits

  - When you call credits() it will print the BPT version alongside with my name.

7. Getting the date

  - You can print the current date with the date() function in: wday, month day year style.

8. Getting the time

  - To print the time in AM PM 12h plus seconds use the timed() function.

9. Getting both time and date

  - Use the timedate() function to print both time and date together.

10. Exit messages

  - To set an exit message you can use emes() to set one, and call it when you want to close the program.

11. Error message
  - Prints a spoof error message, you can choose whether it uses `print()` or `return` the error message. It needs Colorama by the way.

12. The terminal environment
  - Using `init()` you can start the Basic-Python-Toolkit Terminal Environment, where you can run some commands like `cls` and `error`.
13. Colored text
  - You can print(or **return** colored text using the `color()` function, the format goes as follows: `color(text-in-color,color(w,r,g,b,y,c,W),print-if-true(True/False))`
